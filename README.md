# Starter CRUD front end with React and sass.

This is a simple CRUD app in React of generic items.

This is meant to be an starter point to build a CRUD of any type of data modifying the state and components of this template.

This template was built with create-react-app and node-sass.

Hope this helps anybody out there.
